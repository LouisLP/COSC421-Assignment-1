```{R}
library(igraph)
# loading data
nodes <- read.csv("airport_data.csv", header=TRUE)
edges <- read.csv("connections/combined.csv", header=TRUE)

# Create graph object
airports <- graph_from_data_frame(edges, nodes, directed=FALSE)
vertex_attr(airports) <- list(name = nodes$code)

# QUESTION 1
# Number of Edges and Nodes
vcount(airports)  # Vertices
ecount(airports)  # Edges

# QUESTION 2
# Plot and visualize graphs
node.size = c(10, 10, 10)

coords = layout_(airports, in_circle())
plot(airports, vertex.size = 8, edge.arrow = 0.5, vertex.label.cex = 1, layout = coords)

coords = layout_(airports, as_tree())
plot(airports, layout = coords)

coords = layout_(airports, with_sugiyama())

# QUESTION 3
# Compute degrees of airports
degrees <- c(degree(airports, V(airports)))
degrees <- as.vector(degrees)
degrees <- sort(degrees, decreasing = TRUE)
head(degrees, 2)
tail(degrees, 2)

# QUESTION 4
# Histogram of degrees

# QUESTION 5
# Adjacency Matrix
adj <- get.adjacency(airports)
adj <- as.matrix(adj)
isSymmetric(adj)
adj
